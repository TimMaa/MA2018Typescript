# TypeScript 

TypeScript extends Javascript with many new functionalities
without comprosing old standards.   
**Every JavaScript-File is also a TypeScript-File**  
With the addition of the many new features, TypeScript 
becomes a more competitive language than JavaScript alone could
ever be. 

It allows **optional type specifications** as well as an **advanced class concept**
and therefore gives JavaScript an extended and more specific object-orientation,
which not only improves readability for developers, but also additonal tools.

Many of typescripts functionalities, like classes, inheritance or anonymus functions, 
have been implemented in the newest JavaScript version, ECMAScript 6.  
Anyway it still holds other extensions to ECMAScript 6.
